Submission by team TBD.

Our ghost:
  data/ghosts/redsplitt.py  --  see comments

Our lamdaman:
  production/lm_ff.py  --  prototype in complete python
  data/gcpy/ff.py  --  actual strategy in python subset we compiled
  production/gcpy_unit_tests  --  unit tests to data/gcpy/ff.py
Strategy idea: food propagates "force field" which attracts lambdaman.
Ghosts block its propagation.

Our infrastructure allows to automatically play tournaments between lambdamen
(in all three languages: python, python subset and gcc) and ghosts (both in
ghosthon and in ghc).

In the tournament, we used each our map in four orientations. We believe that it
significantly increased variety of situations we explored.

Results of the tournament can be viewed by running
  production/tournament_viewer.py
and visiting the following addresss:
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/table?results_filename=../data/example_results.json

The code has been implemented in Python 2.7.
Everything should be run from production/ as current directory.
If test_all.py fails, you have missing dependencies.
