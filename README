Lightning round solution is generated from a manually built AST. See
gcc_ast.py for the implementation of the AST nodes and gen_gcc.py for the
code that builds the AST for the solution.

We also have a whole bunch of code (game implementation, GHC and GCC
interpreters, map generator and so on) which wasn't directly used for the
lightning round solution.

The code has been implemented in Python 2.7.
