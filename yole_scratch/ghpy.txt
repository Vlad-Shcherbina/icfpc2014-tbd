ghpy supported features
=======================

- Numeric constants
- Arithmetic expressions: + - * /
- Comparison operators: > >= ==
- Function declarations
- References to functions and function parameters
- Function calls
- if statements (generally need to have an 'else' clause)
  - if you put a 'return' statement in one branch of the 'if' statement,
    it also needs to be in the other branch too
- cons cell construction
  - use Python tuple syntax: (a, b)
- cons cell access
  - x[0] maps to 'car'
  - x[1:] maps to 'cdr'
  - you can also use indexes greater than 0 or 1
    - for example, x[2] will be compiled to 'cdr cdr car'
  - indexes must be integer constants (meaning, known at compile time)
